# git-test
Git repository for my path on The Odin Project.
Hello, community! I am proud to be sharing this amazing journey. 

Since now, I have just been working through the Installation Part of The Foundations. 
I am very happy for what this is turning to be: I am not sure I will find a job after this path, 
but I sure am having a good time learning new concepts. It is a challenge, thus it is likeable. 

Looking forward to be able to produce good projects soon!
